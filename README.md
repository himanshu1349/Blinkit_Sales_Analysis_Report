BLINKIT SALES DASHBOARD

Wrapped 🫔 up my latest practice based project and 🚀 excited to showcase the power of data-driven decision-making through this Blinkit sales analysis dashboard. Dive deep into analytics, uncover trends, and make informed decisions!

Project Name: Blinkit Sales Analysis Report

Tools used : Power Bi - (Power BI Desktop, Power Query and DAX) I imported the data from CSV file into Power BI and created visualizations to analyze Amazon sales trends and insights. This involved connecting Power BI to the CSV file, selecting the relevant tables, designing interactive dashboards and creating new Measures using DAX.

Working on this project has been an incredible learning experience. It allowed me to apply my analytical skills and Power BI, and Excel knowledge to real-world business problems. I am passionate about using data to drive meaningful insights. Special thanks to @Data Tutorials for the dataset.

Regards 👍
