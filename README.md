BLINKIT SALES ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

Wrapped up my latest practice-based project and excited to showcase the power of data-driven decision-making through this Blinkit sales analysis dashboard. Dive deep into analytics, uncover trends, and make informed decisions!

Project Name: Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard

Tools Used: Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers)  

I imported the sales data into Excel and created interactive visualizations to analyze Blinkit's sales trends and insights. This involved organizing the data, designing dashboards with slicers for dynamic filtering, and creating charts to represent key performance indicators (KPIs).

Working on this project has been an incredible learning experience. It allowed me to apply my analytical skills and Excel knowledge to real-world business problems. I am passionate about using data to drive meaningful insights.
